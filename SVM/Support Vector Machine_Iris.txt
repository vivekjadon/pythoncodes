Support Vector Machine

1. For this assignment, we will once again return to the famous Iris dataset. 

2. Divide the Iris dataset into two parts: one will contain all of the features (Sepal.Length, Sepal.Width, Petal.Length, Petal.Width), and the other will contain just the Species. 

3. Create an SVM model, which takes as the output variable the species, and input, all of the features. 

4. How many support vectors did you obtain? What was the SVM kernel that was used? 

5. Create a confusion matrix that measures the accuracy of the SVM predictions versus the actual data. How accurate were your results? 

6. Now “tune” the SVM model by changing the cost and gamma parameters. How do changing the values affect the accuracy as reported by the confusion matrix.
